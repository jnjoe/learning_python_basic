coordinates = (4, 5) #tuples is immutable i.e: cant be changed 
#difference between lists and tuples is use of paranthesis in list square bracket in coordinate round bracket
#lists are mostly usede than coordinates
print(coordinates[0])
print(coordinates[1])
#coordinates [1] = 10   will show error if printed as tuplies is immutable cannot be changed
